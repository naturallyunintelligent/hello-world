Having always been a two finger typer and having over 20 years of regular computer use makes changing to touch typing tough. I've tried several times in the past and could never get past the point of finding touchtyping so painfully slow that reverting to my inconsistent and error-prone, but ingrained, two finger technique seemed the only option whilst at work. 
However, over the Christmas break last year, I decided to swap out some movie and Youtube black-hole time to invest in typing and found Typing Club which helped enormously. My two finger typing isn't dead yet, as it's ~35wpm speed still beats the 20–25wpm I can achieve so far with touch typing so I revert to it if under time pressure, but it's worth noting the absolute speed isn't a fair comparison. At 35wpm I make a lot of errors which then need correcting
